# Variable

In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They act
as containers that hold values that can be used and
manipulated throughout the program. To declare a variable
in JavaScript, you can use the <b>var, let, or const</b> keywords.
The <b>let</b> and const keywords were introduced in modern
versions of JavaScript (ES6) and are generally preferred
over var.

# Here are examples of how to declare variables using each keyword:
# var
var age = 30; <br>
var name = "John";

# let
Once a variable is declared, you can assign values to it or update its value:<br>
let age = 30; <br>
let name = "John";

# Using const (for constant values):

const pi = 3.14159; <br>
const appName = "MyApp";
